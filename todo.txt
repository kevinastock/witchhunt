* prototype primary witch hunt interface
* json -> mithril form types 
    * maybe just use button stack for everything + server side processing of clicks?
        * can the boring ass button stack have classes applied to "mark" a button as selected?
        * can we alternate colors on the buttons so it's clearer that they're buttons? Would that help?
    * login form
* json -> LHS cards
* json -> log messages


* how do witches communicate? Maybe have an input box for each of them to type a short message that shows up on other witches screens live?
    * it's shitty because we need a way to cover for players that are typing. but maybe that's ok

* maybe add a header and collapse button at the top of each section? Then user can hide panes they don't want, which makes mobile nicer
    * probably need an icon to notify that something has changed.

* favicon
* serve cdn shit myself
* fuse.js for search?
