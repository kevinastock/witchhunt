* prototype primary witch hunt interface
* json -> mithril form types 
    * maybe just use button stack for everything + server side processing of clicks?
        * can the boring ass button stack have classes applied to "mark" a button as selected?
        * can we alternate colors on the buttons so it's clearer that they're buttons? Would that help?
    * login form
* json -> LHS cards
* json -> log messages


* how do witches communicate? Maybe have an input box for each of them to type a short message that shows up on other witches screens live?
    * it's shitty because we need a way to cover for players that are typing. but maybe that's ok

* maybe add a header and collapse button at the top of each section? Then user can hide panes they don't want, which makes mobile nicer
    * probably need an icon to notify that something has changed.

* favicon
* serve cdn shit myself
* fuse.js for search?


* switch to 2 column view? maybe easier to translate to mobile, and more space for log. put player cards under current action cards.
* or maybe I was right before. 1 column, 3 tabs (public, private, action). maybe no need to paginate log then. server can control active tab which helps in person play.
* use a modal for death actions? Use a modal for all (night?) actions?

... what if, there was just the log - no public/private separation, just one
log. And a button in the hero that pops up a modal w/ character info, admin
buttons, etc.  so the down side is people need to read the log during some
actions. Yea, this is probably a bad idea. but if there's a way to make it work
it'd be great.


* emoji reactions on the log? that'd be amazing. could also be the right way to communicate intent among witches w/o text. names in hover on emojis like slack.
