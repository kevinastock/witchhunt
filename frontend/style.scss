// Custom CSS notes:
//
// 1. ensure the primary text column of tables is as wide as possible as others witl have ~static sized content
//     * Probably need to rename this to something other than .log-table
//
// 2. at least for the voting table, vertical-align to middle so it doesn't look stupid
//     * This might not be good for longer log messages? May want to move phase indicator to bottom
.log-table td:nth-child(2) {
    width: 100%;
}

.table td {
    vertical-align: middle;
}
